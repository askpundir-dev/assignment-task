## 📌 Assignment Instructions

1. Make a duplicate of this Figma by clicking on the drop-down next to the name ‘Assignment’ (visible on the top left side of the screen). Then you can use your local file.
2. Create a new GitHub repository for the assignment. Build the assignment using **React** or **Next.js**.
3. You may use any styling or UI library, such as Tailwind CSS, shadcn, Chakra UI, or Material UI.
4. Keep the left half of the screen empty (but it should be responsive for laptop, not mobile).
5. Focus on the two widgets on the right-hand side.
6. The first widget has three tabs: "About Me", "Experiences" & "Recommended", these should be clickable.
7. In the gallery widget more photos can be added by clicking the **+ Add Image** button.
8. All the components should be responsive (for laptop screens; everything above 768px width).
9. Replicate the exact UI; with exact padding, margins, shadows, interactions (if any).
10. Ensure that the two widgets are accurately aligned with each other (relative right, left padding).
11. Submit the following:
    - Live Assignment Link – Host the assignment on any platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.) and share the live URL.
    - Public GitHub Repository Link – Provide the link to your public GitHub repository containing the assignment code.

**NOTE:** Recreate all interactions and effects visible in the prototype preview (accessible by clicking the Play button at the top right in Figma).
